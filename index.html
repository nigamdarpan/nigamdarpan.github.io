      <p>Swami Nigamananda Paramahansa (born Nalinikanta Chattopadhyay; 18 August 1880 – 29 November 1935) is a Sadguru, Hindu yogi, guru and mystic well known in 
        Eastern India.[3][4][5][6] He is associated with the Shakta tradition and viewed as a perfect spiritual master of tantra, gyan, yoga and prema or bhakti.
        His followers idealized him as their worshipped and beloved thakura.
     Nigamananda was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in the hamlet of Kutabpur in Nadia district (at present Meherpur district Bangladesh).
      He was a sannyasi from Adi Shankar's dashanami sampradaya. After his ordination as a sannyasi, he came to be known as 
      Paribrajakacharya Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Deva.
     Nigamananda achieved siddhi (perfection) in four different sadhanas (spiritual disciplines): tantra, gyan, yoga and prema. 
     Based on these experiences, he wrote five Bengali language books: Brahamcharya Sadhana (ब्रह्मचर्य साधन), Yogi Guru (योगिगुरु), Gyani Guru (ज्ञानीगुरु),
      Tantrika Guru (तांत्रिकगुरु), and Premik Guru (प्रेमिकगुरु). Nigamananda reportedly experienced the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi.
     After retiring from Saraswata Matha, Nigamananda spent the last fourteen years of his life in Puri. Durga Charan Mohanty, a school student, 
     met him at Nilachala Kutir in 1930 and recognized him as sadguru.[18] Mohanty became Nigamananda's disciple and wrote books for Nigamananda's 
     establishment Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and translated Nigamananda's Bengali books into Odia. Under Mohanty's encouragement, more than 100 ashrams
      operate in Odisha. Mohanty continued to spread the message of Nigamananda until his death on 7 December 1985.

      <p>The district of Nadiya in the state of Bengal in India has been a very famous place since a long time. The renowned Vaisnav saint Mahaprabhu Shri Chaitanyadev 
        was born at Nabadwipa, a holy place in this district. It is also the birthplace of several Vaisnav saints and a number of holy men. At that time, Nabadwipa was
         an important seat of learning in Bengal. After the birth of Chaitanyadev, Nabadwipa also became famous for ‘Bhakti Dharma’, the cult of devotional worship of 
         God. The people of Nadiya were highly influenced by the tradition of harmony of Jnana (knowledge) and Bhakti (devotion) prevailing in this district for a long
          time. Kutabpur is a small village in the then subdivision of Meherpur in the district of Nadiya. Now Meherpur is a full-fledged district in the present
           Bangladesh, a new small country adjoining India. It is situated on the bank of the river Vairab. Kutabpur village is a place of residence of various kinds of people including 
      Muslims, weavers, blacksmiths and pottery makers. A few upper caste Hindus also lived in this village.
     Bhubanmohan Bhattacharya, a devout Hindu Brahmin, was an important person of the village. The villagers respected him as a kindhearted, learned and pious Hindu.
      His family surname was Chattopadhyay. Since their family had the legacy of serving as priests, the villagers showed respect to the family by addressing them as 
      ‘Bhattacharya family’. Therefore, Bhubanmohan was known in the locality as Bhubanmohan Bhattacharya and not as Bhubanmohan Chattopadhyay.

      <p>Other key teachings of Nigamananda as stated by Chetnananda Saraswati are:
    Spiritual liberation requires the help of a liberated person (a Master Sadguru or simply Guru). In the Hindu scriptures that person is known as Guru. 
    Without his grace or favor none can make progress. He who has attained the ultimate reality (Paramatman or Brahman) as one and the same as himself (the Atman)
     is the Guru. The Guru cannot be equated in importance to formal learning, pilgrimage or divinity. No other is more worthy of respect.
		The Guru is the embodiment of what the Vedanta teaches – the individual self (the Atman) is one and the same as the cosmic self (Paramatman or Brahman).
    A Sadguru never curses anyone. Even his anger helps the disciple. The advantage of depending on a Sadguru is unique and is superior to depending on God because
     God never materializes to give instructions.
		The Guru and the disciple are inseparable in a way. The Guru cannot exist without being a part of a true disciple's personality or character.
    The two pathways to liberation are by initiation into and observation of the austerities of sannyasa yoga or by service to a Sadguru.
     The former is extremely arduous – the disciple must in a sense die. In other words, he must lose body consciousness. 
     But if one unconditionally loves the Guru by way of rendering service to him sincerely, spiritual liberation may be obtained relatively easily.
		Nothing substantial can be achieved without Guru's grace.
    The mantra that Guru gives during initiation and the disciple's chosen divinity (or Ista) are the same. Unless the Guru becomes the chosen divinity, 
    the mantra received loses its power.
    Acquisition of disciples is not Guru's profession; it is his heart's inspiration. The Guru cares for and guides the disciple hoping that one day the
     disciple will get spiritually enlightened.
